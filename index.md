## Proposed Project
UR QnA is a web-based chat system that will provide a convenient and efficient platform for University of Regina students to ask questions they have about the University during the COVID-19 pandemic. The chat system provides University of Regina students with the ability to obtain immediate answers to questions relating to the University using an online chatbot. If the chatbot is unable to assist them, users will have the ability to schedule an appointment with a front-desk staff member to chat on a one-on-one basis. 

## Project Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Regina transitioned to online learning for most students. Remote learning, however, created a unique set of challenges to pre-existing methods of communication. 
* Faculty and staff members of the University of Regina were working from home and, therefore, students were unable to have their questions answered in person. 
* The voicemail of several university departments was often full and was not accepting any new messages. 
* The last resort was to use email, and this was not necessarily the fastest method of communication, usually taking several business days given the large volume of emails received by the University. 
Consequently, certain questions requiring simple answers were being answered (on average) a few days later which caused frustration among students.

With faculty and staff working remotely, intelligent live chat technology (in combination with chatbot AI) can serve to alleviate some of these communication bottlenecks by providing the ability to communicate in real-time without solely relying on in-person communications, business hours, emails, and phone calls. 

## Business Need/Opportunity
The goal of the UR QnA web application is to remedy the communication problem that is negatively impacting a significant portion of the University of Regina student body. The web-based chat system app is being designed to effectively, efficiently and quickly bridge an existing communication gap between students and the University, and more specifically, between students and front-desk staff. 

UR QnA serves to alleviate these communication problems through the following process:
* Students, both domestic and international, can have their general inquiries answered immediately via the chatbot (available 24 hours a day).
* If their questions are not fully addressed, the app provides a tool to immediately book an appointment with front-desk staff during regular working hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). 
* During the appointment, the student and the staff member can communicate in real-time via the live chat system. The application will also provide a front-desk staff dashboard and student homepage, where users can easily view details about upcoming appointments.
